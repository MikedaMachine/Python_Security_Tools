**Purpose**: The Marietta Country Club has asked you to write a program to gather, then display the results of the golf 
tournament played at the end of March.  The Club president Mr. Martin has asked you to write two programs.
The second program will read the records from the golf.txt file and display them with appropriate headings above the 
data being displayed.
